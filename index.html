                <p>In this world we call college, there are people, broke people, but people none the less. We work day and night,      mostly night but that's ok. That's the life we've signed up for. For the greater good, we must resign ourselves to this reality now. It is simply what must be done. Do not hate the system. It is what it is.

                <p>For some ending thoughts, I figure I should give some sort of parting wisdom. Today's parting wisdom will be to pick up a hobby/game to destress. I recommed Dragon Ball Z: Dokkan Battle(<i><a href="https://t.co/MTMuNzswsl?amp=1">„Éâ„É©„Ç¥„É≥„Éú„Éº„É´ZÔºö„Éâ„ÉÉ„Ç´„É≥„Éê„Éà„É´</a></i>). It's nearing it's <em>6th year</em> and it's pretty fun to play. The 6 year anniversery will be in July so look forward to it. I've also included a hilarious <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYhAIsGWHDw&list=LL&index=4">song</a> about the game (it's Japanese dubbed). In the mean time enjoy some rain music to also help you destress.</p>

                <p>So today, for the most part, was getting the group for the CSE 110 project together. What fun. It seems like I'm in group 19. I hope everyone will be a good colleague. I've heard consistently that much of CSE 110 is based on how good a group is, so here's to hoping that I'm in a good group and am a good group member</p>

                <p>Animals are pretty cute don't you think? I think they're pretty cool. The animals during the CSE 110 lectures were pretty funny to look at, so that was pretty cool. Apart from that the two anime I plan on watching today: Tensura Nikki and Fruits Basket are actually both connected to animals. What a coincidence right?! I think Fruits Basket is great and is a great watch. I've gone ahead and included a trailer for Fruits Basket below. <strong>Beware, there might be spoilers!</strong></p>

                <p>And here we are, starting week 2. Is it just me, or are the weekends just too short. We should get another day at least. In any case, new week, new things to do. Oh boy. But there are some interesting things. At least it's not dead week anymore, so some new anime should come out. Speaking of which <strong>HigeHiro (Higehiro: After Being Rejected, I Shaved and Took in a High School Runaway)</strong> comes out. It's really good and wholesome.</p>

                <p>With a title like Re: Starting a New Week From Not 0, you might be expecting me to make a reference to Re:Zero, but I'm not. Instead I want to talk about light novel titles and how they are <em>(probably)</em> misleading. Over in Japan, it seems like the market for light novels is extremely competitive, so I understand why you'd want to have a title that intentionally causes raised eyebrows. But then again, it may be a complete turnoff. In any case, I'd recommend it. It's very wholesome.</p>
